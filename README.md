myMock -> python HTTP server to get custom response codes
---------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: This is an ongoing work!
I started this project to learn more about servers
and requests-responses model. I will be including new
features as load config.json, response to headers fields,
etc.

Basic mock server to test custom response codes.
After install requirements you can run:
 - $> python MockedCodesServer.py
 - type in your browser localhost:8000/mockserver/code
And you will get 'code' as response code and the associated message.
